          <p class="summary-para">
            In this Hubble Space Telescope image the bright, spiky stars lie in
            the foreground toward the heroic northern constellation Perseus and
            well within our own Milky Way galaxy. In sharp focus beyond is UGC
            2885, a giant spiral galaxy about 232 million light-years distant.
            Some 800,000 light-years across compared to the Milky Way's diameter
            of 100,000 light-years or so, it has around 1 trillion stars. That's
            about 10 times as many stars as the Milky Way. Part of an
            investigation to understand how galaxies can grow to such enormous
            sizes, UGC 2885 was also part of An Interesting Voyage and
            astronomer Vera Rubin's pioneering study of the rotation of spiral
            galaxies. Her work was the first to convincingly demonstrate the
            dominating presence of dark matter in our universe.
